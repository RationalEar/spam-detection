# Explainable Deep Learning for Email Spam Detection: A Comparative Study of Interpretable Models for Email Spam Detection

## 1.	Introduction

Email spam has consistently remained a significant challenge in cybersecurity with spammers constantly evolving their techniques to circumvent traditional spam detection systems. Interestingly, traditional spam detection systems not only include rule-based systems, but now also include machine learning methods. These methods often have limitations in handling complex spam patterns, making deep learning a promising approach to improving spam detection. However, the “black box” nature of deep learning has made its adoption limited in real-world systems. 
Explainability and interpretability are critical for building trust as most users would be interested in understanding why certain emails are classified as spam (Goodfellow et al., 2016). This research aims to explore and compare explainable deep learning models for email spam detection, ensuring both high accuracy and interpretability.
In this study, the performance and explainability of various deep learning architectures, including transformers, convolutional neural networks (CNN), and recurrent neural networks (RNN) will be evaluated. The main goal will be to identify models that strike a balance between detection accuracy and interpretability which will help us understand how the models classify emails as either spam or ham (non-spam) (Vaswani et al., 2017; Ribeiro et al., 2016). The SpamAssassin dataset will be primarily used in this research.

## 2.	Research Objectives

The primary objectives of this research are:
1.	To develop and compare deep learning models (e.g. transformers, CNN, RNN) for email spam detection using the SpamAssassin dataset. 
2.	To incorporate explainability techniques (e.g., attention mechanisms, SHAP, LIME) to interpret model decisions and identify key features contributing to spam classification (Lundberg & Lee, 2017).
3.	To evaluate the trade-offs between detection accuracy and interpretability across different models.
4.	To provide insights on how explainable AI can enhance trust and adoption of deep learning-based spam filters.

## 3. Research Questions

1.	How do different deep learning models perform in detecting email spam?
2.	Which deep learning models provide the best balance between email spam detection accuracy and interpretability?
3.	What are the most important features (e.g. words, phrases, metadata) that contribute to spam classification, and how do they vary across models? 
4.	How can explainability techniques improve user trust and model usability in real-world emails systems (Ribeiro et al., 2016)?

## 4.	Methodology

### 4.1 Dataset
The primary data to be used in this study will be the SpamAssassin dataset which contains labelled spam and ham (non-spam) emails, making it ideal for training and evaluating spam detection models. The data will be preprocessed to:
- Remove irrelevant headers and metadata,
- Tokenize and clean the email body (e.g. removing stopwords, handling special character, etc.),
- Split into training, validation and test sets.

### 4.2 Deep Learning Models
The following deep learning models will be implemented and compared:

#### 1.	Transformers (e.g. BERTS, DistilBERT)
   - Fine-tune pretrained transformer models on the SpamAssassin dataset (Devlin et al., 2019).
   - Use attention weights to identify important words or phrases (Vaswani et al., 2017).
   - Apply post-hoc explainability tools like SHAP or LIME for additional interpretability (Lundberg & Lee, 2017; Ribeiro et al., 2016).

#### 2.	Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
- Train CNNs to extract n-gram features from email text (Kim, 2014).
- Integrate attention mechanisms to highlight important parts of the text (Bahdanau et al., 2015).
- Visualize attention weights for interpretability.

#### 3.	Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN/LSTM):
- Use LSTMs to capture sequential dependencies in email text (Hochreiter & Schmidhuber, 1997).
- Apply integrated gradients to explain model predictions (Sundararajan et al., 2017).

### 4.3 Explainability Techniques
The following techniques will be investigated:
- Attention Mechanisms: To visualize how the model is influenced by different words in the decision process (Bahdanau et al., 2015).
- SHAP (Shapley Additive Explanations): To quantify the contribution or importance of each feature in the classification (Lundberg & Lee, 2017).
- LIME (Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations): To generate explanations for individual email classifications (Ribeiro et al., 2016).
- Integrated Gradients: To attribute the model’s output to input features for RNN-based models (Sundararajan et al., 2017).

### 4.4 Model Evaluation
The metrics that will be used for classification performance are accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score and AUC-ROC. 
For explainability, quantitative metrics like faithfulness (how well explanations match model behavior) and stability (consistency of explanations) will be used. 

### 4.5 Experimental Design
1.	The Preprocess the SpamAssassin dataset and extract relevant features.
2.	Train and fine-tune deep learning models (transformers, CNNs, RNNs).
3.	Apply explainability techniques to interpret model predictions.
4.	Compare models based on detection performance and interpretability.
5.	Analyze results and draw conclusions.


### 5.	Expected Outcomes

1.	A detailed analysis and comparison of deep learning models for email spam detection
2.	Useful insights into the explainability of different models and their practical implications
3.	A framework for building explainable spam detection systems
4.	Recommendations for selecting models based on the trade-offs between accuracy and interpretability. 


## 6.	Significance of Study

This research will contribute to the area of AI-driven cybersecurity by: 
-	Demonstrating the effectiveness of deep learning models in detecting email spam
-	Highlighting the importance of explainability and interpretability in spam detection systems
-	Providing a benchmark for future research on explainable AI in cybersecurity.
-	Offering practical insights for developers and organizations looking to deploy transparent and trustworthy spam detection systems.


## 7.	Conclusion

The sophistication in which spam email continues to evolve requires continuous improvement of spam detection mechanisms and this research aims to contribute to that effort while also bridging the gap between deep learning effectiveness and model transparency. Hopefully, this research will also help build more trust between users and AI-based spam filtering solutions.
